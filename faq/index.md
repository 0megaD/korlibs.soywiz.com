## Are these libraries free?

Yes. All these libraries are dual licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0, except some libraries that I have ported from other languages and were not licensed as MIT, that propagate their own license. But in any case, all the licenses used are free and permissive.

## Contributing

This is an Opensource project.
That means that it is **free of charge**, and that you can **see**, **modify** and **suggest changes** to the source code.
The whole project stack is opensource, so you can contribute to this projectitself, the documentation or even the blog.

Think that this is a huge project that has been initially developed by a single person, and that requires a lot of time.
So probably it will have some rough edges. But you can help to improve it!

### Contributing to the documentation

Did you find **something wrong**? Something **misleading** or **confusing**? Or just want to add more content to the documentation?

In order to make it easier to contribute, each page of the documentation contains a pencil link, that sends you to the github page of the documentation to modify the file itself.

![](/faq/contributing/doc_pencil_button.png)

That link sends you to the file just for viewing, but github provides another pencil button that when pressed will create a fork of the documentation project so you can modify the file and later create a PR with your suggestions.

This project uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for its documentation.
Jekyll is a blogging engine that works out of the box on github.
It also allows to be used as a plain CMS allowing to create custom sites
like this documentation.
