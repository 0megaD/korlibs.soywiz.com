Korge uses **[KorAU](https://github.com/soywiz/korau)** for audio loading,
and playback.

This library is able to load MP3, OGG and WAV files in a portable way,
and it is capable of using native audio loaders.

## Loading sounds and music files

For games, the recommended way of loading sounds and music files is to use the `NativeSound` facility. Typically the `VfsFile.readNativeSound`:

```kotlin
val sound: NativeSound = resourcesVfs["sound.mp3"].readNativeSound()
val music: NativeSound = resourcesVfs["music.mp3"].readNativeSound(streaming = true)
```

The streaming argument instructs KorAU to not fully load the sound at the beginning but to decode it as required.
The streaming option is useful for playing music or voices that are just played once.  

## Playing sounds

To play a sound, you just have to call the play method:

```kotlin
val channel = sound.play()
```

It returns a channel, that you can wait for:

```kotlin
channel.await()
```

Optionally you listen to a callback that executes several times during the play:

```kotlin
channel.await { current: TimeSpan, total: TimeSpan -> // this: NativeSoundChannel
    println("$current/$total")
}
```

Full API:

```kotlin
class NativeSound {
	val length: TimeSpan
	suspend fun decode(): AudioData // Not supported on Android yet
	fun play(): NativeSoundChannel
}

class NativeSoundChannel {
    // Mutable
	var volume: Double
	var pitch: Double // Only implemented on OpenAL for now

    val sound: NativeSound
	val current: TimeSpan
	val total: TimeSpan
	val playing: Boolean
	fun stop(): Unit
    suspend fun await(progress: NativeSoundChannel.(current: TimeSpan, total: TimeSpan) -> Unit = { current, total -> })
}
```

## Audio Streams

KorAU also supports dynamic audio generation (though some targets might have limited support):

```kotlin
// You have first to create a PlatformAudioOutput:
val audioOutput: PlatformAudioOutput = nativeSoundProvider.createAudioStream(freq = 44100)
audioOutput.start()

while (true) {
    // Then you have to add samples. This function suspends, and resumes when it needs more data so it can play the data continuously. 
    // Here you can do raw manipulation, DSP, manual effects and other stuff.
    audioOutput.add(...)
}

audioOutput.start(stop)
```

The `PlatformAudioOutput` API:

```kotlin
class PlatformAudioOutput {
	val availableSamples: Int
	suspend fun add(samples: AudioSamples, offset: Int = 0, size: Int = samples.totalSamples)
	suspend fun add(data: AudioData)
}
```


## Platform Format support and considerations

### JS

JavaScript uses the WebAudio API. Almost all the browsers limit this API after a first interaction.
So you won't be able to play sounds before the user clicks or taps.
This restriction doesn't apply to Apache Cordova targets, but only to normal browsers.

The most widely format supported in the browsers via JavaScript is MP3. You can check the compatibility tables here:

* <https://caniuse.com/#feat=mp3>
* <https://caniuse.com/#feat=vorbis>
* <https://caniuse.com/#feat=opus>

### Native (Desktop and iOS)

Native targets use OpenAL as audio backend except for Windows that uses the standard waveout API.  

On native platforms there is WAV, OGG and MP3 support out of the box. Using public these domain libraries:

* MP3: [minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3)
* OGG Vorbis: [stb_vorbis](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c)

### Android

On Android KorAU uses the Android's MediaPlayer:

* List of supported formats: <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats>

### JVM

On the JVM KorAU uses `javax.sound.sampled` APIs.

Since this API only support WAV files by default, you have to include separate artifacts to be able to play other formats
in the JVM.

```kotlin
korge {
	dependencyMulti("com.soywiz.korlibs.korau:korau-mp3:$korauVersion") // To be able to play mp3
	dependencyMulti("com.soywiz.korlibs.korau:korau-ogg-vorbis:$korauVersion")
}
```

This artifact includes a `ServiceLoader`, so you won't have to register them manually.
They are not included with KorGE directly since they have separate licenses (LGPL) that would force
me to propagate the license to the rest of the libraries.
