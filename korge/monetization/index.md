In order to monetize your game, KorGE provices some out of the box plugins to do so:

{% include toc.html context="/korge/monetization/" %}

You can also create or use any of your own multiplatform libraries.
Or [create a korge-plugin](/korge/plugin/) if that library require configuring things like the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
