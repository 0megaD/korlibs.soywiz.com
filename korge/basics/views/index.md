Korge's views works like [AS3's DisplayObject](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/DisplayObject.html) or the HTML DOM. It is intended for 2D rendering, though you can create custom views with 3D content rendering with KorAG.

It is **a tree structure** where `View` has a parent, and `Container` has other `View` as children.

Then when **KorAG performs the rendering**, it starts drawing from the bottom to the top. Just like [Painter's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm).
