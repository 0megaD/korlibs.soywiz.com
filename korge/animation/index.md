## Tweens

Korge integrates tweens and easings, and it is fully integrated with coroutines for your coding pleasure.

Also animations files are first citiziens of the Korge Game Engine.

## ANI/SWF Files

<img src="/animation/swf/logo.png" />

Korge supports [SWF Adobe Flash/Animate files](/animation/swf) and can support
other custom formats through extensions/plugins.
For example it would be possible to create an exporter for *After Effects* or *Apple Motion*.

Korge defines a custom ANI file format for animations.
Atlas based with sound support.

You can preview ANI/SWF files (as they will look in runtime) right in intelliJ, using Korge's intelliJ plugin (*that uses Korge itself for rendering!*):
